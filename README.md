# Cloud

Provides a simple orchestration of a Ruby on Rails deployment on macOS within a localised containerized environment utilising a XHYVE hypervisor.

## Why?

I want to provide a standarized way to manage infrastructure, to enable development teams to work on a consistent platform, whilst lowering the entry bar to build containerized apps.
